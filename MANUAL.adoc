:theme_name: Arch Terminal
:slug: arch-terminal
:prog_version: 2.0.0


NOTE: The configuration snippets are in TOML format.
Be sure to convert it into your data format of choice.

A fork of the original https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal[Hugo Terminal theme] with some of its original feature set being removed to be replaced for new ones.

Aimed for technical writers, programmers, tech enthusiasts, and people with a do-it-yourself (DIY) spirit.
As such, some IKEA-style assembly will be required.

This theme provides a minimal and readable base theme while providing a lot of ways to customize it.

When settling with this theme, you should be prepared for some tweaking of the settings like how you customize your precious text editors and OS configs.
Also have some prerequisite knowledge of the web languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for an easier time.

On an unrelated note, https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/dotfiles[here are my dotfiles].

This manual is for {theme_name} version {prog_version} and above.

NOTE: Some of the features are only possible (such as applying and editing SCSS) with Hugo extended version.
Please make sure that you have it installed.




== Objectives

The author of this extended theme (@foo-dogsquared) has several objectives in creating this theme.

Reading this might make you understand the limitations and the strength of this theme.

Here are the following objectives the theme aims to do:

* Provide an Asciidoctor-supported Hugo theme for those who are writing with
Asciidoctor.

* Maintain consistent and readable format for your content.

* Provide the theme as a UI/skin for your content.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Meaning no custom shortcodes and minimal custom frontmatter for your content.
This also enables easy migration and future-proofing your content
as much as possible.

* Go out of its way as much as possible for your content while providing customization options in order to fit your general needs.
You focus on implementing the more advanced and more specific stuff.

* Be as easy as possible to be able to modify the source files of the theme.
This theme will not be able to cover all possible (or even common) use cases.
This encourages creating your own solution if you aren't able to find what you're looking for.




== Demo

Here's a https://foo-dogsquared.github.io/hugo-theme-arch-terminal-demo/[demo] of the theme.
It features a fairly customized version showing off what you can do once you invested a bit of your time to experiment and explore the options with this theme.

The raw files can be easily seen in https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-arch-terminal-demo/[my GitHub repo].
It should give you an idea of using it in a real-life example.
The demo also utilizes https://travis-ci.com/[Travis CI] as the deployment tool.
Check out the https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-arch-terminal-demo/blob/master/.travis.yml[config file] of it to get an example.

You can also get the https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-arch-terminal-demo/blob/master/config.toml[configuration] of the theme used from the demo.
It should be usable and can be a great starting point to explore the available options and can be used to experiment along reading through the documentation.




== Feature highlights

Here are the different feature highlights that
the theme offers:

* A recreation of the original theme, built from scratch.

* Focuses on being minimal while being customizable enough for you.
The choice of bloating your website is in your hands! :)

* Easy configuration and customization with https://sass-lang.com/[SCSS]. footnote:requires_hugo_extended[Requires Hugo extended version.]

* Primarily focuses on including support for https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].

* Different approach of content organization.

* Removed https://nodejs.org/[Node] dependencies from the original theme.

The theme aims to be minimal but provides a variety of customizability like having a set of building blocks.
This also holds the philosophy of (almost) full customization to the user, allowing them to express themselves which is why the theme provides lots of optional stuff.
Even if you start with no options at all, it can be usable.
Though what's the fun if you can't tweak some settings, right?

Here's a general list of options that you can set and experiment with this theme.
(Note that all of the listed features needs to be manually activated.
It's supposed to be minimal, after all.)

* https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax] support.
* Lazy syntax highlighting support https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS].
* Multilingual mode support.
* Theme switch toggle (also known as dark mode).
It will create the alternate theme even if you didn't customize it yourself!
(Though, may result in ugly colors.) footnote:requires_hugo_extended[]
* Site breadcrumbs.
* LaTeX-like content counters.
* Customizable social links.
* Custom 404 messages.
* Twitter cards, OpenGraph schema, and JSON+LD schema.
* Image zoom feature for your content.
* Built-in search indexing and widget with https://fusejs.io/[Fuse.js].
* Quick taxonomy search query list.
* Adding custom JS libraries for the whole site or for specific posts.
* Google Analytics integration.
* Disqus integration.

Interested to know more?
Please take a gander at the whole document to know your options.




== Changelog

To keep up with the changes and latest features, you can view the link:CHANGELOG.adoc[changelog].

All future features has to be implemented in a separate development branch (`develop`) and you can view the pending changes there.




== Installation

Since this theme uses Hugo Pipes and asset bundling, it requires the extended version of Hugo.
In order to check whether or not you have the extended version installed, just run `hugo version` and check for the keyword `extended` after the version number.

For future references and safety purposes, make sure that the version is at least `v0.57.2`.

If you're using Asciidoctor, make sure that the version is at least `v2.0.10`.


TIP: Harnessing the full feature set such as editing and applying SCSS and JavaScript files requires Hugo extended version.



=== Adding it as a clone

Assuming you have installed the appropriate programs and using https://git-scm.com/[Git], you can clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-terminal-plus-minus.git themes/terminal-plus-minus
----

If you don't want to make any radical changes, this is the best option since you can simply update it (i.e. `cd themes/terminal-plus-minus && git fetch`) whenever updates are available.


=== Adding it as a submodule

You can also include it as a https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[git submodule].
This option is mostly suitable if you want to make changes to the theme from its layouts, partials, and assets.

[source,bash]
----
git submodule add https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-terminal-plus-minus.git themes/terminal-plus-minus
----


=== Adding it as a Hugo module

NOTE: To make use of this feature, you have to install the latest link:https://golang.org/[Go] runtime.

One of the recent additions of Hugo are link:https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/[Hugo modules] which allows for a more powerful and flexible theme components be made possible.

To start, you have to initialize your Hugo project as a Hugo module itself with `hugo mod init $HUGO_MOD_NAME` where `$HUGO_MOD_NAME` can be any string.
footnote:[If you're publishing a Hugo module publicly, you have to name it appropriately — e.g., `github.com/$USERNAME/$PROJECT`.]

Next, edit your site configuration to add the theme in the module list.

[source, toml]
----
[[module.imports]]
  path = "github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-arch-terminal"
----

Finally, download the theme component with `hugo mod get`.




== Libraries used

For future references, here is the list for the libraries included with this theme along with their version:

* https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax] v3.0.0 under Apache License Version 2.0 (all versions)
* https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS] v1.23.0 under MIT License
* https://fusejs.io/[Fuse.js] v3.4.5 under Apache License Version 2.0
* https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom[medium-zoom] v1.0.6 under MIT License



== Configuration

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration.
You can copy the sample configuration below and try to experiment with it.
https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/[Default configuration settings] also apply here.

NOTE: From this point, this assumes that you want to create the config as a TOML file.
Please change the format according to your chosen data format for your configuration file.

|===


=== Changing appearance

NOTE: Editing and applying SCSS files is only possible with Hugo extended version.
If you are using the basic version, override the styles with a CSS stylesheet at `static/scss/main.min.css` (or the equivalent `static` location at the assets folder).

If you want to change common styles like the background color, text color, or the main color, you can add a `config.scss` file in `assets/scss` in your Hugo project directory.
You can view the link:assets/scss/default.scss[default SCSS config file] for a reference to what variables should be filled.

If you want to override the styles, you can create a file named `extend.scss` in `assets/scss` of your Hugo project directory.
From there, you can simply add/modify/remove some styling rules yourself.

If you want to add some custom fonts, make sure you'll define them through https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face[`@font-face`] rule.
For placing font files, you can put them in the `static/fonts` folder.

For those who haven't encountered SCSS yet, it's almost like a superset of CSS but with additional stuff.
Here's a https://sass-lang.com/guide[guide] and the https://sass-lang.com/documentation/[documentation] page to get started.




== Adding contact

In most cases, you may want to link your profile from other platforms to provide more ways of reaching your audience.
Thus, you want to provide a list of links which this theme provides a way to declaratively configure that list.

Unlike link:https://themes.gohugo.io/[most themes from the community] where it only lets you configure your contacts for a handful of social platforms, this theme provides the entire link:https://simpleicons.org/[Simple Icons] set.
footnote:[Practically a couple of hundred icons since not all are social media.]

All you need to do is to create a data file at `data/{slug}/contacts.{json,toml,yaml}`.
The data requires an array of objects with the following schema.

[cols="5*",options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Data type
| Description
| Optional
| Additional notes

| `id`
| string
| The identifier for the object.
|
| This ID will be used as the `symbol` in the SVG spritesheet file in `static/social-icons.svg` in the theme folder.
The social icons are extracted from https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons[Simple Icons set].

| `url`
| string
| The hyperlink of the additional contact.
|
|

| `name`
| string
| The name of the contact link.
| Yes
| If the links are set to be text, the value of this key will be used.
Otherwise, if the links are set to be text and there's no value to this key, the `id` will be used, instead.

|===

By default, the hyperlinks for your contacts are in text.
If you want to make it into an icon, you could set the parameter `params.useLinkIcons` to `true` in the site config file.
Be cautious of using this, since any unavailable icons will not be rendered.

.`useLinkIcons` set to `true`
image::docs/show-link-icons-enabled.png[width=100%]

.`useLinkIcons` set to `false` (recommended)
image::docs/show-link-icons-disabled.png[width=100%]

For completeness sake, here's an example data.

[source, json]
----
[
    {
        "id": "github",
        "url": "https://github.com/john_dodo/",
        "name": "GitHub"
    },
    {
        "id": "keybase",
        "url": "https://keybase.io/john_dodo",
        "name": "Keybase"
    },
    {
        "id": "twitter",
        "url": "https://twitter.com/john_dodo",
        "name": "Twitter"
    }
]
----




== Color scheme toggle configuration

You can have theme toggling (or dark mode as others might call it) for your site.
It is disabled by default but you can enable it by setting `params.enableThemeToggle` on your site configuration.

You can also customize your second theme from its background to its font (actually, I think that's it).
See the link:assets/scss/default.scss[`assets/scss/default.scss`] file to see the variables needed for the second theme.

If the second theme is not explicitly configured, it'll be derived from the first theme.
Beware as it will usually get ugly results.
Manually configuring it yourself is still the best way.




== Customization

With the focus on blogging, content organization should be a breeze.
(Of course, as long as it follows the way of https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/[organizing content from Hugo].)


=== Content organization

The way how the theme organizes content (and encourages) is simple.
The theme simply considers all of the content in the content directory as-is.
To do something with it, you can look into what Hugo offers such as link:https://gohugo.io/content-management/build-options/[their build options] allowing you to exclude a certain page or a directory.

You can also specify to list only certain sections by setting https://gohugo.io/functions/where/#mainsections[`params.mainSections`].
It requires an array of directories relative to the content directory where it will list all of the content under those specified folders — e.g., `mainSections = [ "articles" "projects" ]`.


=== Content frontmatter

Here are some of the keys in the content frontmatter used by the theme:

[cols="5*",options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Description
| Optional
| Additional notes
| Example

| `title`
| The title of the post.
| Yes but actually no
| If the given data is null or not valid, it'll appear
with no title at all and it'll be a pain to sort this out so
you're on your own, pal.
| `"Markdown Syntax Guide"`

| `date`
| The publication date of the post.
| Yes but actually no
| If the given data does not result to a proper date format or if it's null value, its publication date will appear as published on 2001-01-01 (January 1, 2001).
Also a pain to sort this out.
| `2019-08-25T21:06:56+08:00`

| `categories`
| The categories associated with the post.
*Must be an array composed of only one string.*
This is mostly for the default setting from
https://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll].
| Yes
| One of the https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/#default-taxonomies[default taxonomies].
Mainly useful to establish general grouping for your posts.
Categories are not included in building feeds.
| `["guide"]`

| `tags`
| The tags associated with the post.
*Must be an array with at least one string.*
| Yes
| Also one of the https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/#default-taxonomies[default taxonomies].
Mostly useful for establishing some indexes for the posts.
Also used for the output format feeds (RSS, Atom, JSON feed).
| `["markdown", "guide"]`


| `author`
| The author of the particular post.
| Yes
| Use this if you have a guest post or has multiple authors in the site.
| `"Rob Pike"`

| `cover`
| The banner image of the post.
| Yes
| Accepts URL or a relative path to the image.
| `http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/maxresdefault.jpg`

|===


=== Content pagination

The theme offers an optional pagination section on single page templates where the previous and next entries are shown.

To enable this feature, set `params.enableContentPagination` to `true`.

image::docs/enable-content-pagination.png[Content pagination has been enabled, width=100%]


=== Post archive page

You can make a quick archive page by creating a content file with the content type as `archive`.
Assuming that you have `content/archives.md` as the page for the archive, create a frontmatter similar to the following.

[source,yaml]
----
---
title: "Archives"
date: 2019-08-28T14:32:44+08:00
layout: "archives"
---
----

Don't forget to edit the site config file accordingly.
In this case, the added setting should be an additional item in the navigation menu which is controlled by the `menu` parameter.

[source,toml]
----
[menu]
    // ...
    [[menu.main]]
        identifier = "archives"
        name = "Archives"
        url = "archives/"
----

Here's a sample of the archive page in the site.

image::docs/archive-sample-page.png[width:100%]


=== Content counters

You can enable content counters that behave similarly to https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Counters[LaTeX counters] by setting `params.useContentCounters` to `true`.

.Content counters
image::docs/use-content-counters-enabled.png[width:100%]

This is mostly helpful to quickly establish hierarchy and not to make it confusing for your readers.

The counters are only enough to support the HTML tags `<h2>`–`<h6>` (`<h1>` is assumed to be the main document title).
Any more than that (if that's even possible) is not supported anymore and can only go through some more tweaking.


=== Site breadcrumbs in post

The most useful one is the breadcrumbs feature that'll appear in the top of your posts.

.Breadcrumbs in the post
image::docs/post-breadcrumbs-enabled.png[]

In order to be able to use it, set the `params.enableBreadcrumbs` to `true` in your site config file.

NOTE: Each segment is extracted from the title of each section (i.e., `title` key from the frontmatter).
Be sure to have the title set in the frontmatter for each section (e.g., create a file named `_index.md` and write the frontmatter there).


=== Content image zoom

You can add an image zoom feature similar to the image zoom function
in Medium articles. footnote:requires_hugo_extended[]

Of course, it's disabled by default and should be manually enabled with
`params.enableContentImageZoom`.

It relies on https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom/[medium-zoom] for the functionality.

NOTE: The version used in the theme is at v1.0.4.


=== Quick taxonomy search list

This featured is inspired from
https://www.ii.com/[this site's taxonomy pages].
It provides a quick list of search queries of different sites when in a https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/[taxonomy page] located at the bottom of the page.

It can be customized by providing a data file named `query` which holds a list of objects/dictionaries with the following keys:

[cols="5*",options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Data type
| Description
| Optional
| Additional notes

| `id`
| string
| The name of the site.
|
| The list will be sorted alphabetically based from this key.

| `url`
| string
| The URL of the site that leads to a search results page.
|
| Requires the pattern `${{\\__DATA__}}` somewhere in the string to denote the taxonomy term.

|===


=== "Back to top" button

You can simply put a simple back to top button with `params.enableBackToTopLink`.
It's located at the footer just before your contact links.




== Multilingual mode support

This theme supports https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/[multilingual mode] for your site.
Please see the linked documentation and https://regisphilibert.com/blog/2018/08/hugo-multilingual-part-1-managing-content-translation/[this featured blog post] to get started.

In order to get started, add the language(s) that you'll be hosting your content with the `languages` object in your site configuration.
For consistency, the theme requires a language code based from https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry[IANA Language Subtag Registry] as defined from the https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags[W3 documentation].

The language selector can be found at the very bottom of the site.
Any content with translations are also introduced along with the content metadata and the title.

The theme should be able to support changing the tiny details such as the title and the menu as long as you provided the appropriate data.

You can find the translations files at link:./i18n[`i18n`] folder with the
available languages.
If the language you find is not available, you can help translating
it and add it into the supported language list.

NOTE: Personally, I recommend to make your site config into a
https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-directory[`config` folder].
It's going to make site config management more organized.




== Adding your own libraries

=== Adding it sitewide

TIP: If you want finer control, I recommend to modify the script partial of the theme instead (at `theme/arch-terminal/layouts/partials/scripts.html`).
By doing it this way, you can add some additional scripts such as configuration of your library or rearranging it.

This theme supports adding your own JS libraries and CSS stylesheets to your site quickly by utilizing a data file named `libraries`.

By providing this feature, you can quickly add some features such as supporting engineering-oriented content with https://mermaidjs.github.io/[Mermaid], https://www.chartjs.org/[Chart.js], and similar libraries.
Or you could replace the syntax highlighters here.

Similar to adding your projects and contact links, the data file should hold a list
of objects with certain keys/fields.

[cols="5*",options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Data type
| Description
| Optional
| Additional notes

| `type`
| string
| Specifies what type of resource the item will be.
Only accepts possible values which are `js` and `css`.
|
|

| `url`
| string
| The URL of the JS file to be loaded.
|
|

| `weight`
| number
| The order which the script will be loaded.
Similar to the `weight` field from Hugo menu object,
the less weight, the higher the precedence.
Make sure the more important scripts have the least weight value.
|
|

| `sync`

=== Adding JS libraries for a specific post

TIP: If you plan on future-proofing your content, I recommend to
embed it on the document itself than relying on the frontmatter since this is
a theme-specific feature and may present some problems if you migrate it somewhere else.
For Markdown, you can simply write raw HTML with it.
On Asciidoctor, you can simply embed it with a
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#passthroughs[passthrough block].
You also gain finer control on embedding your scripts this way.

You can also add a JS file to a specific document by adding a
`libs` object with `js` nested object on the frontmatter.

Let's say you're writing an article on https://p5js.org/[p5.js].
Rather than adding the library site-wide (which is very inefficient), you can
add it for that specific page.
Here's how you can add it to your frontmatter.

[source,asciidoc]
----
---
title: "Testing out p5.js"
date: 2019-09-07T02:55:46+08:00

libs:
    js:
        - "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.9.0/p5.min.js"
---
----

Libraries and scripts imported this way are loaded first before the site-wide scripts.
Also, all of them are loaded asynchronously (with the `async` attribute) and you
have no way of controlling them.
If you're looking for finer control, I recommend to embed them into the document
itself instead.




== Custom 404 page

If you want to change it, simply copy link:layouts/404.html[`layouts/404.html`]
from the theme folder to your own `layouts` folder and change it from there.

As the official documentation has said, you can only see the 404 page in the
server mode by visiting `localhost:1313/404` (or something similar if you have
different ports for your `localhost`).




== MathJax support

MathJax is included with the theme and needs almost no configuration in order for it to work.
Like most of the highlighted features here, it's disabled by default.
You can enable by setting `params.enableMathjax` to `true`.

By default, it uses v3.0.0 which is the latest production version as of 2019-09-06.

Take note that it uses the default configuration so there might be some need to configure it.
In case that you do need configuration, you can copy the script partial (at `theme/{theme_name}/layouts/partials/scripts.html`) and add the configuration at the appropriate location (there should be a comment telling you where to put it).

NOTE: Read the https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/[official MathJax documentation for more information] and to understand more how this theme integrates MathJax.

Assuming you didn't change the configuration or anything, here are the breakdown for writing LaTeX in the web according to the https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html#tex-and-latex-input[MathJax documentation].


=== Markdown content

* Inline math content should be delimited with a pair of backslash
and parenthesis (\\(...\\)).
* Display/block math mode should be delimited with a pair of
square brackets (\\[\\]) or two dollar signs (\$\$).
You may have to escape it with a backslash (\).

.Example of math content in a Markdown file
[source,markdown]
----
For inline math, you could make dollar signs-delimited content blocks like
the following example and it'll appear like $a_{1}^{2} + a_{2}^{2} = b_{1}^{2} + b_{1}^{2}$.

For display/block math mode, make the content block delimited with two dollar signs
or a pair of brackets.

\[\LaTeX\]
----


=== Asciidoctor content

* Math support is included in Asciidoctor but
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#activating-stem-support[you have to enable it by putting `:stem:` in the preamble].
The theme already takes care of that for you by including it in the archetype template.
* Since the theme uses the default setting for MathJax, the stem interpreter is explicitly
set to `latexmath`.
* Inline math content should be put in the `stem` macro.
* Display/block math content should be put in the stem block.

.Example of math content in a Asciidoctor file
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document title
:stem: latexmath

For inline math, you could make dollar signs-delimited content blocks like
the following example and it'll appear like stem:[a_{1}^{2} + a_{2}^{2} = b_{1}^{2} + b_{1}^{2}].

For display/block math mode, make a stem block.

== Lazy syntax highlighting

Lazy syntax highlighting (enabling it without the `highlight` shortcode) is supported through https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS].
The syntax highlighter encourages the https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/textlevel-semantics.html#the-code-element[semantic HTML for code listings] in order to color the syntax.

Fortunately, both of the default Markdown parsers and Asciidoctor outputs semantic HTML for code listings so both of them are supported.

By default, the lazy syntax highlighting is disabled.
To enable it, set the value of `params.enableLazySyntaxHighlighting` to `true` in your site config.

[source,toml]
----
[params]
    enableLazySyntaxHighlighting = true
----

Now that lazy syntax highlighting is enabled, you can simply use the normal code listings with Markdown or Asciidoctor (other formats are yet to be tested) like so:

.Markdown source code listing
[source,markdown]
----
```js
console.log("Hello world");
```
----

.Asciidoctor source code listing
[source,asciidoc]
....
[source,js]
----
console.log("Hello world");
----
....

If you want to have control of how it works, you can always modify link:layouts/partials/scripts.html[the scripts component] in the appropriate section.




== RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds support

For those who are looking to find more ways of distributing their content into the world of crap, an output feed might fill your needs.

This theme does not have web feed templates but we can make use of link:https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-web-feeds[a dedicated web feed Hugo module] that is compatible with this theme.
Here's an example where we install the component with Hugo modules (be sure to `hugo mod init $NAME` first!).

CAUTION: Also, be sure to check out the repo of the component, the following example snippet may not have up-to-date instructions.

[source,toml]
----
[module]
    [[module.imports]]
        path = "github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-web-feeds"

# Including all of the feed output formats in the build
[outputFormats]
    [outputFormats.RSS]
        mediaType = "application/rss+xml"
        baseName = "feed"

    [outputFormats.Atom]
        mediaType = "application/atom+xml"
        baseName = "feed"

    [outputFormats.JSON]
        mediaType = "application/feed+json"
        baseName = "feed"


# Indicating what output formats shall be included for the following kinds
[outputs]
    # .Site.BaseURL/$basename.* is available
    home = ["HTML", "JSON", "RSS", "ATOM"]

    # .Site.BaseURL/$section/$basename.* is available
    section = ["HTML", "JSON", "RSS", "ATOM"]
----

Then run `hugo mod get && hugo serve` footnote:[`hugo serve` can actually get the modules by itself but I included the `hugo mod get` for demonstration purposes.] and it should have published the web feeds.


=== Limitations

In order to prevent diving into complexity, there is a set of limitations you have to keep in mind.

* No pagination.
Only the first 10 (or given `params.feedLimit`) shall be shown at any time to prevent excessive bandwidth usage.




== Site search widget

NOTE: This requires Hugo extended version in order to work.

This theme offers a site-wide search navigation widget with https://fusejs.io/[Fuse.js] as the search engine.

How it works is simply through building a static search engine index in `{{ $.Site.BaseURL }}/index.search.json` and utilizing the search engine library when the reader visits a web page.

CAUTION: This is not recommended for large sites since the search engine will run entirely on the visitor's device.
Instead, I recommend to use a server-sided search indexing service like https://www.algolia.com/[Algolia].

It requires two steps setup to enable it.

* Setting `params.enableSiteSearch` to `true` in your site config.
* Adding a custom output format for the search index to be built.

Here's what the site config file should have (assuming it is in TOML):

[source,toml]
----
# ...

[mediaTypes]
    # You can set any media type you want but make sure it doesn't have any conflict with
    # other media types (that'll be used by your site, anyway).
    # Here's the list of registered media types for a reference.
    # https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
    [mediaTypes."x-application/search+json"]
        suffixes = ["search.json"]

[outputFormats]
    # ...

    [outputFormats.SearchIndex]
        mediaType = "x-application/search+json"
        baseName = "index"

[outputs]
    home = ["HTML", "SEARCHINDEX"]

# ...

[params]
    # ...
    enableSiteSearch = true
----

The feature uses https://fusejs.io/[Fuse.js] as the search engine.
The file can be found on link:assets/js/lib/fuse.min.js[`assets/js/lib/fuse.min.js`].

== Issues with Asciidoctor and other stuff

Since Asciidoctor only recieves basic support through https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#additional-formats-through-external-helpers[external helpers], there are some imperfections with this theme (rather, overall) when using with Hugo.

* First and foremost, the HTML output of Asciidoctor doesn't observe proper semantics.
Therefore, some additional styling may be done since it goes against usual content formatting compared to other outputs from other content formats like Markdown.
This also affects the screen reading accessibility so take utmost caution when creating a workaround like using https://github.com/jirutka/asciidoctor-html5s[an Asciidoctor backend with semantics in design] and https://blog.anoff.io/2019-02-17-hugo-render-asciidoc/[using a shadow executable hack done by a blogger with Hugo and Asciidoctor].

* Using callouts with the `:icons: font` attribute enabled will bring out some problems regarding to rendering the highlighted syntax with https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS].
It is advised to use https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] instead.




== Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

[qanda]
How are my files not listed in the site?::
You may have forgotten to unset the content as a draft (i.e., `draft` key in the frontmatter).
Delete the specified key or set the value as `false`.

Why is the site breadcrumbs appear as not complete?::
The breadcrumbs component gets the title of each section.
Some sections may not have a title (i.e., missing `title` key in the frontmatter).
If the section does not have a title yet, create `_index.md` and set the `title` key in the frontmatter.

Why is there no icon for `[INSERT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM HERE]`?::
The social media icons are extracted from the link:https://simpleicons.org/[Simple Icons] set.
`[INSERT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM HERE]` may not have an icon from the set which you can link:https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/issues[file an icon request] for including it (if possible).
Or you may have given the wrong `id` which correspond to the filename from the icon set.
To know the correct `id`, you may have to search in the link:https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons[repo].




== How to contribute

If you spot some bugs or want to suggest a feature, feel free to file an issue in the issue tracker.

Any feature requests are heavily considered since starting at v2.0.0, a feature freeze is observed for the sake of improving user experience (including the documentations), bug fixes, and content readability for the theme as much as possible.
It also avoids the problem of over-engineering and gold plating since the theme already has a lot of options/parameters to offer.


=== Setting up for development

If you want to contribute through code, you can do the following to set up the repo into your computer:

* Fork this repository
* Clone the forked repository
* Create another branch from the development branch which you can freely implement your own stuff

Also make sure to install the latest Go runtime since this project makes use of Hugo modules.

And be sure to create an appropriate name for the new branch before creating a pull request.


=== Project style guides

If you're going to update the codebase, make sure you mind the following guidelines:

* The documentations have to be written in https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].
If you're not familiar with it, here's the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[quick reference page] for a rundown and their https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[user manual] for deep details.
* The codebase follows the http://getbem.com/naming/[BEM naming convention] for the CSS naming.
* Using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines[semantic HTML] should be observed.
* Not really a requirement but use the https://editorconfig.org/[EditorConfig] plugin for your text editor.
If you don't have any, try to follow according to the `.editorconfig` rules.
