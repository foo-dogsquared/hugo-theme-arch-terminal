= Arch Terminal
:toc:

A fork of the 
original https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal[Hugo Terminal theme] 
with some of its original feature set being removed to 
be replaced for new ones.

Aimed for technical writers, programmers, tech enthusiasts, and 
people with a do-it-yourself (DIY) spirit. 
This theme provides a minimal and readable base theme while providing a lot 
of ways to customize it. 
When settling with this theme, you should be prepared for some 
tweaking of the settings like how you customize your precious 
text editors and OS configs. 

On an unrelated note, 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/dotfiles[here are my dotfiles]. 




== Demo 

Here's a 
https://foo-dogsquared.github.io/hugo-theme-terminal-plus-minus-demo/[demo] 
of the theme. 

The raw files can be easily seen in 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-terminal-plus-minus-demo/[my GitHub repo]. 
It should give you an idea of using it in a real-life example. 
The demo also utilizes 
https://travis-ci.com/[Travis CI] as the deployment tool. 
Check out the 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-terminal-plus-minus-demo/blob/master/.travis.yml[config file] 
of it to get an example. 

You can also get the 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-terminal-plus-minus-demo/blob/master/config.toml[configuration] 
of the theme used from the demo. 
It should be usable and can be a great starting point to explore 
the available options and can be used to experiment along reading through the 
documentation. 




== Feature highlights

Here are the different feature highlights that 
the theme offers:

* A recreation of the original theme, almost built from scratch.
* Focuses on being minimal while being customizable enough for you. 
The choice of bloating your website is in your hands! :) 
* Easy configuration and customization with https://sass-lang.com/[SCSS].
* Primarily focuses on including support for https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. 
* Different approach of content organization. 
* Aims on supporting engineering and technical content. 
* Removed https://nodejs.org/[Node] dependencies from the original theme. 

The theme aims to be minimal but provides a variety of customizability like 
having a set of building blocks. 
This also holds the philosophy of (almost) full customization to the user, 
allowing them to express themselves which is why the theme provides lots of 
optional stuff. 
Even if you start with no options at all, it can be usable. 
Though what's the fun if you can't tweak some settings, right? 

Here's a general list of options that you can set and experiment with this theme. 

* Support RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds. 
* Suitable for creating a quick single homepage portfolio and/or blogging.
* https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax] support. 
* Lazy syntax highlighting support with https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] 
or https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS]. 
* Multilingual mode support. 
* Theme switch toggle (also known as dark mode).
* Customizable normal and alternate theme appearance. The theme will also set 
the alternate theme even if you didn't customize it yourself! 
(Though, may result in ugly colors.) 
* Site breadcrumbs. 
* Customizable social links. 
* Built-in search indexing and widget with https://fusejs.io/[Fuse.js]. 
* Quick taxonomy search query list. 
* Google Analytics integration. 
* Disqus integration.

Please take a gander at the whole document to know your options. 




== Changelog

To keep up with the changes and latest features, you can view the 
link:CHANGELOG.adoc[changelog]. 

All future features has to be implemented in a separate development 
branch (`develop`) and you can view the pending changes there. 




== Installation

Since this theme uses SASS/SCSS asset bundling, it requires 
the extended version of Hugo. 
In order to check whether or not you have the extended 
version installed, just run `hugo version` and check for 
the keyword `extended` after the version number.

For future references and safety purposes, make sure that 
the version is at least `v0.57.2`.

If you're using Asciidoctor, make sure that the version is at 
least `v2.0.10`.



=== Adding it as a clone

Assuming you have installed the appropriate programs and 
using https://git-scm.com/[Git], you can clone it directly 
to your Hugo folder:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-terminal-plus-minus.git themes/terminal-plus-minus
----

If you don't want to make any radical changes, this is the best option 
since you can simply update it 
(i.e. `cd themes/terminal-plus-minus && git fetch`) whenever updates 
are available.


=== Adding it as a submodule  

You can also include it as a 
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[git submodule]. 
This option is mostly suitable if you want to make changes to the 
theme from its layouts, partials, and assets. 

[source,bash]
----
git submodule add https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-terminal-plus-minus.git themes/terminal-plus-minus
----




== Libraries used

For future references, here is the list for the libraries 
included with this theme along with their version:

* https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax] v2.7.6 and v3.0.0
* https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] v9.15.10 
* https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS] v1.17.1 
* https://fusejs.io/[Fuse.js] v3.4.5 




== Configuration

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. 
You can copy the sample configuration below and try to experiment 
with it.
https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/[Default configuration settings] 
also apply here. 

NOTE: From this point, this assumes that you want to create the 
config as a TOML file.
Please change the format according to your chosen data format for 
your configuration file.

----



=== Changing appearance

If you want to change common styles like the background color, 
text color, or the main color, you can add a `config.scss` file 
in `assets/scss` in your Hugo project directory.
You can view the link:assets/scss/default.scss[default SCSS config file] 
for a reference to what variables should be filled.

If you want to override the styles, you can create a file named 
`extend.scss` in `assets/scss` of your Hugo project directory. 
From there, you can simply add/modify/remove some styling rules yourself. 

If you want to add some custom fonts, make sure you'll define them through
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face[`@font-face`] rule. 
For placing font files, you can put them in the `static/fonts` folder. 

For those who haven't encountered SCSS yet, it's almost like a superset 
of CSS but with additional stuff. 
Here's a https://sass-lang.com/guide[guide] and the 
https://sass-lang.com/documentation/[documentation] page to get started. 




== Making a portfolio site

This theme is suitable for creating a single portfolio page.
Please continue to the following sections for the available options 
and other stuff you might need to know.



=== Related configuration options 

Here are the main site config options you may want to look out 
for if you want to create a single page portfolio site:

[cols="5*",options="header"]

| 

| `params.useLocalMathjax`
| boolean 
| Enables offline usage of MathJax.

|===



=== Adding projects

You can also add some projects to your data by adding a 
data file named `projects` (i.e. `projects.json`, `projects.yaml`, etc.) 
into your https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/[data folder].
Make sure that the data file holds an array/list of objects/dictionaries with 
the specified fields.

When there's at least one project, a projects section will 
be added into your homepage and the data added in the 
appropriate folder is added under it.


Anyhow, here's the following keys/fields that the theme 
look for:

[cols="5*",options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Data type
| Description
| Optional
| Additional notes

| `id`
| string
| The identifier for the project.
| 
| 

| `name`
| string
| The name of the project. 
This is the name that'll appear in the homepage. 
| 
| 

| `description`
| string
| The description of the project.
| Yes
| 

| `link`
| string
| The website/homepage of the working project. 
| Yes
| This is not where the link to the remote repository of the project. 

| `repo`
| string
| The link to the repo of the project.
| Yes 
| 

|===

If you want to see a live example of it, you can check out my 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/foo-dogsquared.github.io[the repo of my own site] 
and check the output of it in https://foo-dogsquared.github.io/[my site].


=== Adding contact

If you want to add some links to your other stuff like 
GitHub, GitLab, Twitter, and whatnot, you can add a 
data file named `contacts` (i.e. `contacts.json`, `contacts.yaml`, etc.) 
in the https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/[data folder].
Like the `projects` data file, make sure that it contains an array/list 
of objects/dictionaries with the specified fields. 

Here's a table of the following key/fields that theme looks for:

[cols="5*",options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Data type
| Description
| Optional
| Additional notes

| `id`
| string
| The identifier for the object.
| 
| This ID will be used as the `symbol` in the SVG spritesheet file in 
`static/social-icons.svg` in the theme folder. 
The social icons are extracted from 
https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons[Simple Icons set]. 

| `name`
| string
| The name of the contact link.
| Yes
| If the links are set to be text, the value of this key will be used.
Otherwise, if the links are set to be text and there's no value to this 
key, the `id` will be used, instead.

| `url`
| string
| The hyperlink of the additional contact.
| 
| 

|===

By default, the hyperlinks for your contacts are in text. 
If you want to make it into an icon, you could set the 
parameter `params.useLinkIcons` to `true` in the site config file.
Be cautious of using this, since any unavailable icons will 
not be rendered. 
In order to see how this works, it basically relies on using 
https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/[SVG spritesheets] 
in `static/social-icons.svg` (in the theme folder) with symbols.

.`useLinkIcons` set to `true`
image::docs/show-link-icons-enabled.png[width=100%]

.`useLinkIcons` set to `false` (recommended)
image::docs/show-link-icons-disabled.png[width=100%]

NOTE: The whole spritesheet is extracted from the 
https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/[Simple Icons icon set].



=== Color scheme toggle configuration 

You can have theme toggling (or dark mode as others might call it) 
for your site. 
It is disabled by default but you can enable it by setting `params.enableThemeToggle` 
on your site configuration. 

You can also customize your second theme from its background to its 
font (actually, I think that's it). 
See the link:assets/scss/default.scss[`assets/scss/default.scss`] file 
to see the variables needed for the second theme. 

If the second theme is not explicitly configured, it'll be derived from the 
first theme. 
Beware as it will usually get ugly results. 
Manually configuring it yourself is still the best way. 




== Making a blog site

This theme is also suitable to be a blogging theme. 
Most of the stuff from making a single homepage site also applies here.

With the focus on blogging, content organization should be a breeze.
(Of course, as long as it follows the way of 
https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/[organizing content from Hugo].)

Unlike the original theme, it doesn't find a name of the 
folder to list its pages. 
Instead, all of the files and directories under `content/` 
should be able to be listed (except for the top-level files 
probably).

If you want to make a post series, you could either put 
the content files under `posts/` and assign the same category 
to all of them or simply make a folder named after the series 
and put the content files there.



=== Related configuration options 

There are some parameters in the site configuration you might 
want to try out if you're using it for blogging. 

[cols="5*",options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Data type
| Description
| Optional
| Additional notes

| `params.contentIsStyled`
| boolean
| Makes the single page template content to have 
some styles into them (see the resulting headers, for example).
| Yes
| This is just for decorative purposes.

| `params.enableBreadcrumbs`
| boolean
| Enables 
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/breadcrumbs-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices/[site breadcrumbs] 
in the posts (single page templates) that'll appear at the top of the post.
| Yes
| 

| `params.enableContentPagination` 
| boolean 
| Enables the content pagination section in your single page templates 
that is found at the bottom of the content section. 
| Yes 
| 

| `params.enableSiteSearch`
| boolean
| Enables navigation through searching. 
The search widget is located at the bottom of the page. 
| Yes
| This feature is experimental. 
Don't expect a lot of stability with this. 
If your site is large enough, I recommend to integrate with stronger tools 
such as Algolia. 

| `params.enableLazySyntaxHighlighting`
| boolean
| Enables lazy syntax highlighting without relying to the 
built-in highlight shortcode.
This uses https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS] for the highlight feature.
| Yes
| This also enables native syntax highlighting for Asciidoctor! 
Hallejulah! 

| `params.enableMathjax`
| boolean
| Enables MathJax in the page.  
| Yes (but not for me) 
| For performance reasons, it'll be used through a CDN. 

| `params.feedLimit` 
| boolean 
| Specifies how many posts should be listed at a time in the 
output formats (i.e. RSS, Atom, etc.). 
Default value is 10. 
Values less than or equal to 0 is also considered to the default value. 
| Yes 
| 

| `params.listSiteSectionsOnHome`
| boolean
| Indicates if the homepage should list the 
site sections (top-level directories of the site)
instead of the pages 
| Yes
| You need to have `showPostsOnHome` set to `true` to 
make have this effect visible. 

| `params.readMoreLabel` 
| string 
| Replaces the "Read more" text at the very end of the summary of each post.
| Absolutely 
| 

| `params.readOtherPostsLabel`
| string 
| Replaces the label of the content pagination header. 
| Yuparoo
| 

| `params.setMathjaxToV2`
| boolean
| Set the MathJax version to v2.  
| Yes 
| 

| `params.showPageTypeIcon`
| boolean
| Shows the icon for page type (either if it's a folder or a file in 
the content folder) in the home page.
| Yes, completely
| For the theme, a page is a "folder" if its base filename is `_index`. 

| `params.showPostsOnHome`
| boolean
| Indicates if the homepage should show the pages 
from the content folder.
| Yes
| 

| `params.syntaxHighlighter` 
| string 
| Sets the syntax highlighter to be used. 
Valid options include `highlightjs` and `prismjs`. 
When no value is given, it'll use highlight.js as the default 
syntax highlighter.
| Yes 
| Despite being the same in goal (coloring syntax), it has subtle 
differences in results. 
See the "Issues in Asciidoctor and other stuff" section. 

| `params.searchLabel`
| string 
| Replaces the search label in the search widget (if activated).
| Yessir
| 

|===


=== Content organization

The way how the theme organizes content (and encourages) 
is simple. 
The theme considers all of the pages and sections except for 
the top-level pages. 

By default, the theme does not list posts in the homepage. 
In order to do so, set the `params.showPostsOnHome` to `true` on 
your site config file. 
All of the posts (except for the top-level pages) are now 
listed in the homepage. 

NOTE: Folders with an `_index` file is considered a 
section so it'll be listed. Make sure any pages that shouldn't 
normally appear in the post list be a single page. 

.`showPostsOnHome` set as `true`
image::docs/show-posts-on-home-enabled.png[width=100%]

If you want to list sections instead of the page, you should 
enable the `params.listSiteSectionsOnHome` to `true` on the site 
config file. 
Take note that the `params.showPostsOnHome` also needs to be 
enabled for this setting to work.

.`listSiteSectionsOnHome` set as `true` 
image::docs/list-site-sections-on-home-enabled.png[width=100%] 


=== Content frontmatter

Assuming you didn't modify the theme in any way, here are 
some of the keys in the content frontmatter used by the 
theme:

[cols="5*",options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Description
| Optional
| Additional notes
| Example

| `title`
| The title of the post.
| Yes but actually no
| If the given data is null or not valid, it'll appear 
with no title at all and it'll be a pain to sort this out so 
you're on your own, pal.
| `"Markdown Syntax Guide"`

| `date`
| The publication date of the post.
| Yes but actually no
| If the given data does not result to a proper date format 
or if it's null value, its publication date will appear as 
published on 2001-01-01 (January 1, 2001).
Also a pain to sort this out. 
| `2019-08-25T21:06:56+08:00`

| `categories`
| The categories associated with the post. 
*Must be an array composed of only one string.* 
This is mostly for the default setting from 
https://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll]. 
| Yes 
| One of the 
https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/#default-taxonomies[default taxonomies].
Mainly useful to establish general grouping for your posts. 
Categories are not included in building feeds. 
| `["guide"]`

| `tags`
| The tags associated with the post. 
*Must be an array with at least one string.* 
| Yes
| Also one of the 
https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/#default-taxonomies[default taxonomies]. 
Mostly useful for establishing some indexes for the posts. 
Also used for the output format feeds (RSS, Atom, JSON feed). 
| `["markdown", "guide"]`


| `author`
| The author of the particular post.
| Yes 
| Use this if you have a guest post or has multiple authors in the site.
| `"Rob Pike"`

| `cover`
| The banner image of the post. 
| Yes
| Accepts URL or a relative path to the image.
| `http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/maxresdefault.jpg`

|===



=== Post archive page

You can make a quick archive page by creating a content file with 
the content type as `archive`. 
Assuming that you have `content/archives.md` as the page for the 
archive, create a frontmatter similar to the following.

[source,yaml]
----
---
title: "Archives"
date: 2019-08-28T14:32:44+08:00
type: "archive"
---
----

Don't forget to edit the site config file accordingly. 
In this case, the added setting should be an additional 
item in the navigation menu which is controlled 
by the `menu` parameter. 

[source,toml]
----
[menu]
    // ...
    [[menu.main]]
        identifier = "archives"
        name = "Archives"
        url = "archives/"
----

Here's a sample of the archive page in the site.

image::docs/archive-sample-page.png[width:100%]



=== Quick taxonomy search list

This featured is inspired from 
https://www.ii.com/[this site's taxonomy pages]. 
It provides a quick list of search queries of different sites when 
in a https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/[taxonomy page] 
located at the bottom of the page. 

It can be customized by providing a data file named `query` which 
holds a list of objects/dictionaries with the following keys:

[cols="5*",options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Data type
| Description 
| Optional
| Additional notes

| `id`
| string
| The name of the site. 
| 
| The list will be sorted alphabetically based from this key. 

| `url`
| string
| The URL of the site that leads to a search results page. 
| 
| Requires the pattern `${{__DATA__}}` somewhere in the string to denote 
the taxonomy term. 

|===



=== Other tidbits

There are a couple of options for miscellaneous stuff and info that you 
might want to find out.

==== Site breadcrumbs in post
The most useful one is the breadcrumbs feature that'll appear in 
the top of your posts.

.Breadcrumbs in the post
image::docs/post-breadcrumbs-enabled.png[]

In order to be able to use it, set the `params.enableBreadcrumbs` to 
`true` in your site config file. 

==== Icon on post list

Another one of the features you could try it out is the icons that'll 
appear in the side of the post list. 
This indicates whether or not the list item is a page or a section. 
It could be useful for navigating your site.

.`showPageTypeIcon` set as `true` with a "file" type page
image::docs/page-type-icon-file.png[width=100%]

.`showPageTypeIcon` set as `true` with a "folder" type page
image::docs/page-type-icon-folder.png[width=100%]

In order to enable it, set the `params.showPageTypeIcon` to `true`.

==== Stylized content in the post

This might be the most useless feature I've ever done. 
Anyways, this'll make certain header types to have some sort 
of style put into them.

.Stylized content headers
image::docs/content-is-styled-enabled.png[width=100%]

In order to enable it, set `contentIsStyled`

.`contentIsStyled` set as `false`
image::docs/content-is-styled-disabled.png[width=100%]




== Multilingual mode support 

This theme supports 
https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/[multilingual mode] 
for your site. 
Please see the linked documentation and 
https://regisphilibert.com/blog/2018/08/hugo-multilingual-part-1-managing-content-translation/[this featured blog post] 
to get started. 

In order to get started, add the language(s) that you'll be hosting 
your content with the `languages` object in your site configuration. 
For consistency, the theme requires a language code based from 
https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry[IANA Language Subtag Registry] 
as defined from the 
https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags[W3 documentation]. 

The theme should be able to support changing the tiny details such as the 
title and the menu as long as you provided the appropriate data. 

You can find the translations files at link:./i18n[`i18n`] folder with the 
available languages. 
If the language you find is not available, you can help translating 
it and add it into the supported language list. 

NOTE: Personally, I recommend to make your site config into a 
https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-directory[`config` folder]. 
It's going to make site config management more organized. 


== Custom 404 page

If you want to change it, simply copy link:layouts/404.html[`layouts/404.html`] 
from the theme folder to your own `layouts` folder and change it from there. 

As the official documentation has said, you can only see the 404 page in the 
server mode by visiting `localhost:1313/404` (or something similar if you have 
different ports for your `localhost`).




== MathJax support

MathJax is included with the theme and needs almost no configuration 
in order for it to work. 
Like most of the highlighted features here, it's disabled by default. 
You can enable by setting `params.enableMathjax` to `true`. 

For performance reasons, it'll rely on a CDN instead of saving it 
locally. If you want to use it based on your own web server, you 
can set `params.useLocalMathjax` to `true`. No need to worry about the 
fonts since the local MathJax script uses SVG instead for the rendering. 

NOTE: `params.useLocalMathjax` is exclusive for v3. 

By default, it uses v3.0.0 which is the latest production 
version as of 2019-09-06. 
You can still use the previous major version from v2.7.6 with this theme 
by setting `params.setMathjaxToV2` to `true`. 

Take note that it uses the default configuration so there 
might be some need to configure it. 
In case that you do need configuration, you can create a file in 
`layouts/partials/config/mathjax.html` and do your stuff there. 

NOTE: Read the 
https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/[official MathJax documentation for more information] 
and to understand more how this theme integrates MathJax. 

Assuming you didn't change the configuration or anything, here are 
the breakdown for writing LaTeX in the web according to the 
https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html#tex-and-latex-input[MathJax documentation].


For Markdown-based files:

* Inline math content should be delimited with a pair of backslash 
and parenthesis (\\(...\\)).
* Display/block math mode should be delimited with a pair of 
square brackets (\\[\\]) or two dollar signs (\$\$). 
You may have to escape it with a backslash (\).

.Example of math content in a Markdown file
[source,markdown]
----
For inline math, you could make dollar signs-delimited content blocks like
the following example and it'll appear like $a_{1}^{2} + a_{2}^{2} = b_{1}^{2} + b_{1}^{2}$.

For display/block math mode, make the content block delimited with two dollar signs.

\[\LaTeX\]
----


For Asciidoctor-based files:

* Math support is included in Asciidoctor but 
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#activating-stem-support[you have to enable it by putting `:stem:` in the preamble]. 
The theme already takes care of that for you by including it in the archetype template. 
* Since the theme uses the default setting for MathJax, the stem interpreter is explicitly 
set to `latexmath`. 
* Inline math content should be put in the `stem` macro. 
* Display/block math content should be put in the stem block. 

.Example of math content in a Asciidoctor file
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document title
:stem: latexmath

For inline math, you could make dollar signs-delimited content blocks like
the following example and it'll appear like stem:[a_{1}^{2} + a_{2}^{2} = b_{1}^{2} + b_{1}^{2}].

For display/block math mode, make a stem block.

== Lazy syntax highlighting

Lazt syntax highlighting (enabling it without the `highlight` shortcode) 
is supported through https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS] 
and https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js]. 
Both of the syntax highlighters follows the
https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/textlevel-semantics.html#the-code-element[semantic HTML for code listings] 
in order to color the syntax.

Fortunately, both of the default Markdown parsers and Asciidoctor 
outputs semantic HTML for code listings so both of them are supported. 

By default, the lazy syntax highlighting is disabled. 
To enable it, set the `enableLazySyntaxHighlighting` under 
`params` to `true` in your site config file. 
This uses highlight.js by default. 
In order to use PrismJS, set `params.syntaxHighlighter` with the value 
`"prismjs"`. 

Assuming you're using a TOML as your config file.

[source,toml]
----
[params]
    # ...
    enableLazySyntaxHighlighting = true

    # if you want to set PrismJS as the syntax highlighter
    # syntaxHighlighter = "prismjs"
----

NOTE: If you're curious to the files being used, the script for 
the syntax highlighters is at `assets/js/lib` of the theme folder. 

Now that lazy syntax highlighting is enabled, you can simply use the 
normal code listings with Markdown or Asciidoctor (other formats are yet to be 
tested) like so:

.Markdown source code listing
[source,markdown]
----
```js
console.log("Hello world");
```
----

.Asciidoctor source code listing
[source,asciidoc]
....
[source,js]
----
console.log("Hello world");
----
....



=== Changing themes 

The CSS used for syntax highlighting is at `assets/css/` file. 
There should be separate stylesheet for each syntax highlighters with 
the same name (i.e. `highlightjs.css`, `prism.css`). 

For highlight.js, you can change the theme by having `highlightjs.css` 
in the `assets/css` folder. 
You can look for different themes in 
https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles[their GitHub page].

For PrismJS, you can replace the theme by having `prism.css` in the 
`assets/css` folder. 
You can replace the theme by going to 
https://prismjs.com/download.html[the PrismJS download page], select 
the theme you want and putting it in the aforementioned file.  

NOTE: The PrismJS script file contains the core, all of the 
languages offered as of v1.16.0, and the 
https://prismjs.com/plugins/keep-markup/[Keep Markup plugin] 
(this plugin is important if you want to use 
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#callouts[callouts in Asciidoctor]). 
In order to update PrismJS, you need to download the script file yourself 
at https://prismjs.com/download.html[the PrismJS download page] and 
select the languages it'll support.




== RSS, Atom, and JSON output feed 

This is mostly applicable for those who use the theme for blogging. 
The theme support RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds. 

For future references, here are the following documents used to refer in 
creating the feed templates: 

* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287[Atom 1.0 - IETF RFC4287]
* https://jsonfeed.org/version/1[JSON Feed version 1 specifications]
* https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html[RSS 2.0 specifications] 

The generated RSS and Atom output has been tested against the 
https://validator.w3.org/feed/[W3C feed validator] and it has been valid so far. 
For JSON feeds, it has been tested on 
https://json-feed-validator.herokuapp.com/validate[a JSON feed validator] and 
produces the same valid result.

NOTE: Personally, I recommend using Atom feeds since it is widely recognized 
and 
http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Rss20AndAtom10Compared[it does have a better format than RSS]. 

In order to enable it, utilize custom formats in your site configuration. 

The output format template is in the layout folder named `index` with their 
respective file extensions (`.rss`, `.atom`, `.json`). 
They also have a list counterpart at `_default/list` with the same respective 
file extension. 

All of them support outputs for the homepage (from `index.$FILE_EXT`) and 
lists (from `list.$FILE_EXT`). 

Here's an example which will make all of the feeds appear at `index.rss`, 
`index.atom`, and `index.json`. 

[source,toml]
----

# Visit the following for more information:
# https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats

# Defining the media type of the output formats
# For JSON format, it doesn't need to be since it's already built-in into Hugo
[mediaTypes]
    [mediaTypes."application/atom+xml"]
        suffixes = ["atom", "atom.xml"] # You can remove the "atom.xml" if you want
    
    # Redefining RSS media type for the additional suffix
    [mediaTypes."application/rss+xml"]
        suffixes = ["rss", "rss.xml"] # You can remove the "rss.xml" if you want


# Including all of the feed output formats in the build
[outputFormats]
    [outputFormats.Rss]
        mediaType = "application/rss+xml"
        baseName = "index"

    [outputFormats.Atom]
        mediaType = "application/atom+xml"
        baseName = "index"

# Indicating what output formats shall be included 
# for the following kinds
[outputs]
    # .Site.BaseURL/index.* is available 
    home = ["HTML", "JSON", "RSS", "ATOM"]

    # .Site.BaseURL/$section/index.* is available
    section = ["HTML", "JSON", "RSS", "ATOM"] 
----



=== Limitations 

In order to prevent diving into complexity, there is a set of limitations you 
have to keep in mind.

* No pagination. 
Only the first 10 (or given `params.feedLimit`) shall be shown at any time. 
* It doesn't support multiple site authors. 
It always assumed that the site only has one author. 
* The same deal for posts. 
In case that there is an `author` field in the frontmatter of the post, 
it'll only support one author, not an array of them. 




== Site search widget

This theme offers a site-wide search navigation widget with 
https://fusejs.io/[Fuse.js] as the search engine. 

How it works is simply through building a static search engine index 
in `{{ $.Site.BaseURL }}/index.search.json` and utilizing the search engine 
library when the reader visits a web page. 

CAUTION: This is not recommended for large sites since the search engine 
will run entirely on the visitor's device. 
Instead, I recommend to use a server-sided search indexing service 
like https://www.algolia.com/[Algolia]. 

It requires two steps setup to enable it.

* Setting `params.enableSiteSearch` to `true` in your site config. 
* Adding a custom output format for the search index to be built. 

Here's what the site config file should have (assuming it is in TOML): 

[source,toml]
----
# ... 

[mediaTypes]
    # You can set any media type you want but make sure it doesn't have any conflict with 
    # other media types (that'll be used by your site, anyway).
    # Here's the list of registered media types for a reference.
    # https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
    [mediaTypes."x-application/search+json"]
        suffixes = ["search.json"]

[outputFormats]
    # ...

    [outputFormats.SearchIndex]
        mediaType = "x-application/search+json"
        baseName = "index"

[outputs]
    home = ["HTML", "SEARCHINDEX"] 

# ...

[params]
    # ... 

    enableSiteSearch = true
----

The feature uses https://fusejs.io/[Fuse.js] as the search engine. 
The file can be found on link:assets/js/lib/fuse.min.js[`assets/js/lib/fuse.min.js`].

== Issues with Asciidoctor and other stuff

Since Asciidoctor only recieves basic support through 
https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#additional-formats-through-external-helpers[external helpers], 
there are some imperfections with this theme 
(rather, overall) when using with Hugo.

* First and foremost, the HTML output of Asciidoctor doesn't observe
proper semantics. 
Therefore, some additional styling may be done since it 
goes against usual content formatting compared to other 
outputs from other content formats like Markdown. 
This also affects the screen reading accessibility so take 
utmost caution when creating a workaround like 
using https://github.com/jirutka/asciidoctor-html5s[an Asciidoctor backend with semantics in design] 
and 
https://blog.anoff.io/2019-02-17-hugo-render-asciidoc/[using a shadow executable hack done by a blogger with Hugo and Asciidoctor].

* Using callouts with the `:icons: font` attribute enabled will 
bring out some problems regarding to rendering the highlighted syntax with 
https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS], it is advised to use 
https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] instead.

* Using highlight.js as the syntax highlighter doesn't style well. 
I tried my best to style it but manual styling will be required. 
If you're sure with using it as the syntax highlighter, 
just add the following CSS syntax:

[source,css]
----
pre.highlight {
    padding: 0;
}
----




== How to run your site

From your Hugo root directory, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
hugo server -t terminal-plus-minus
----

You can also add the following line to site config file:

[source,toml]
----
theme = "terminal-plus-minus"
----




== How to contribute

If you spot some bugs or want to suggest a feature, feel 
free to file an issue in the issue tracker. 



=== Setting up for development

If you want to contribute through code, you can do the following 
to set up the repo into your computer:

* Fork this repository 
* Clone the forked repository 
* Checkout to the development branch (`develop`) 
* Create another branch from the development branch which you can 
freely implement your own stuff 

Make sure the new branch name is appropriately named. 

If creating a pull request, you have to pass it through the 
development branch. 



=== Project style guides

If you're going to update the codebase, make sure you mind the 
following guidelines:

* The documentations have to be written in https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. 
If you're not familiar with it, here's the 
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[quick reference page] for 
a rundown and their https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[user manual] for 
deep details. 
* The codebase follows the http://getbem.com/naming/[BEM naming convention] 
for the CSS naming.
* Using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines[semantic HTML] 
should be observed.
* Not really a requirement but use the https://editorconfig.org/[EditorConfig] 
plugin for your text editor. 
If you don't have any, try to follow according to the `.editorconfig` rules. 




== TODO

Here are some of the features that are considered to be 
implemented. 
Any help with this task list by pull requests are very 
appreciated. 

* Algolia integration
* Focus support for engineering and technical content 
* Internationalization (i18n) support
* Different https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/[archetypes] 
and content organization
