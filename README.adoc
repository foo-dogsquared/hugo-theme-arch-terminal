= Arch Terminal
:toc:

:version: v3.0.0


A complete remake of the original https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal[Hugo Terminal theme] with additional features, new development build, and a totally different philosophy.
Also focuses on including support for Asciidoctor content.

Aimed for technical writers, programmers, tech enthusiasts, and people with a do-it-yourself (DIY) spirit.
As such, an IKEA-style assembly will be required.

It also aims to be a portfolio and/or blog of a single author.
If it's supposed to be a site for multiple author, then this is not for you (or you could hack it yourself).

This theme provides a minimal base theme while providing a lot of ways to customize it.
It also goes out of its way as much as possible as a UI component for your content.
(Meaning no custom shortcodes and frontmatter to deal with this theme.)

Be sure to read the link:./MANUAL.adoc[manual] for more details.
Nonetheless, with minimal configuration, it should be still enough to get started writing content.




== Demo

Demo is available https://foo-dogsquared.github.io/hugo-theme-arch-terminal-demo/[here].
The demo features more posts, serves as a documentation of some sort, and highlights with a detailed configuration.

The raw files of the demo is available in https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-arch-terminal-demo/[a GitHub repo].
I also recommend to see the https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-arch-terminal-demo/blob/master/config.toml[config file] used in the demo.
It's also well-commented so you can use it as a starter configuration for this theme.




== Manual

This is more like a "Getting Started" guide so please read the link:./MANUAL.adoc[manual] for more details.
This document only opens up a part of the things that you can do with this theme.

You think you can escape the manual?
Not a chance.




== Features

Here's a general list of options that you can set and experiment with this theme.
(Note that all of the listed features needs to be manually activated. It's supposed to be minimal, after all.)

* Support RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds.
* Suitable for creating a quick single homepage portfolio and/or blogging.
* https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax] support.
* Lazy syntax highlighting support with https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS].
* Multilingual mode support.
* Theme switch toggle (also known as dark mode).
* Customizable normal and alternate theme appearance. The theme will also set the alternate theme even if you didn't customize it yourself!
(Though, may result in ugly colors.)
footnote:needs-hugo-extended[Needs Hugo extended version.]
* Site breadcrumbs.
* LaTeX-like content counters.
* Customizable social links.
* Custom 404 messages.
* Custom content reader mode for easier readability for your readers.
* JSON+LD schema.
* Image zoom feature for your content.
* Built-in search indexing and widget with https://fusejs.io/[Fuse.js].
* Quick taxonomy search query list.
* Adding custom JS libraries for the whole site or for specific posts.
* Google Analytics integration.
* Disqus integration.




== Prerequisities

This theme needs the following software and its required version.

* Hugo v0.58.0 and above.
Also, make sure it's the extended version which you can check by running `hugo version`.

* The latest link:https://golang.org/[Go] runtime.




== Installation

This theme requires Hugo v0.58.0 and above.
However, some of the features of this theme can only be used with the extended version (such as applying edited SCSS files) so make sure you have it installed if you want the full package.

Also, the remote repo of this project is hosted on GitHub.
Thus, it uses Git as the version control system.

On your Hugo project, you can install the theme on two ways:


=== Installing by cloning

You can simply clone the Git repo of the theme.

[source,sh]
----
git clone --branch {version} https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-arch-terminal.git themes/arch-terminal
----

This is a good option if you don't to modify the base theme too much.


=== Installing with submodule

You can also install the theme utilizing link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[Git submodules].

[source,sh]
----
git submodule add --branch {version} https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-arch-terminal.git themes/terminal
----

If you want to make major changes to the theme, then this might be the
option you're looking for.


=== Installing with Hugo module

TIP: This is the recommended installation method since this theme already makes use of Hugo module so why not use it yourself?

To start installing this theme as a link:https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/[Hugo module], you need to initialize your Hugo project as a Hugo module â€” i.e., run `hugo mod init $HUGO_MOD_NAME`.
Then, edit your configuration (e.g., `config.toml`) to add the theme as an additional module.

[source, toml]
----
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-arch-terminal"
----

After the project has been configured to add the module, run `hugo mod get` (or `hugo serve`) to download the dependencies.




== Building with the theme

Now that you have the theme with the project, let's see it in action.

Run the following command and see the result:

[source,sh]
----
hugo serve -t arch-terminal
----

You can also add the following into your site configuration to serve with the theme without repeating the above command.

NOTE: If you've added the theme as a Hugo module, there's no need to do the following block since it is done automatically (unless you have a special case of using multiple themes).

[source,toml]
----
theme = "arch-terminal"
----




== Basic configuration

To get started, you can start with a simple and minimal configuration and work your way out there.

The theme is mostly suitable to be simple single-page portfolio or a blogging theme (or both).

Want to start right away? Here's the most minimal configuration of the theme.

[source,toml]
----
title = "Arch Terminal"
----

Seriously, that's it. :) You just completed the "Hello World" of making a Hugo site.
link:./docs/true-hugo-minimalism.png[Enjoy the view of your Hugo site with *T R U E M I N I M A L I S M* and no bloat.]

Ignore my rambling and let's continue on to the README, shall we?
Try to follow along the README, if you wish for a more fulfilling experience (of configuring a Hugo theme, that is).


=== Configuring appearance

You can change the appearance of the theme.
Start by copying `themes/arch-terminal/assets/scss/config.scss` to your own assets with similar directory structure (`assets/scss/config.scss`).
*Note that you need to have Hugo extended version installed to apply edited SCSS stylesheets.*
Otherwise, you would have to overwrite with a CSS stylesheet (at `scss/main.min.css`) instead and the following section does not apply anymore.

Also, please open `themes/arch-terminal/assets/scss/default.scss` to see the variables needed.

On second thought, here's the SCSS config file (as of 2019-09-07).

[source,scss]
----
// Create one at the similar location in your
// Hugo directory.

// To know what variables you should modify, take a
// look at `default.scss`.

// Here's a sample custom config with pretty colors and everything
// (at least for me) and try with the theme toggle switch.
// If there's no alternative palette given, it will set the
// alternate theme automatically for you.

// For those who cares about using font stacks, I've provided a quick list for you
// It's a mixed combination of free and open source fonts and system fonts,
// feel free to modify it as you wish
// Monospace: "Fira Code","Source Code Pro","IBM Plex","Monaco","Consolas","Ubuntu Mono","Bitstream Vera Sans Mono",monospace
// Sans: "Fira Sans","Copper Hewitt","IBM Plex",sans
// Serif: "Source Serif Pro","Charter","IBM Plex","Georgia",serif

// Here's a quick sample config for you. Try it out and enable theme toggling for a bit.
// $background: #703d57;
// $foreground: #dce2c8;
// $accent: #f28a3c;
// $fontFamily: sans-serif;
// $fontSize: 1.2rem;
----

It's empty. You can try to uncomment the comments for a start or open up the `default.scss` file from the theme folder to see the available variables.


=== Setting alternative themes

Here's the best part, it can generate an alternative theme (dark mode or whatever) automatically even if you provide those variables.

Please uncomment the part with the SCSS variables and add the `params.enableThemeToggle` in your site configuration like so:

[source,toml]
----
[params]
    # ...
    enableThemeToggle = true
----

And see the magic alternative toggle!

Go on and change the colors and believe!




== Adding contact

What would a portfolio be without the creator's recognition?

You can add a list of contact by providing a data file named `contacts` (`data/contacts.{json,yaml,toml}`).
Similar to the projects data file, it should hold a list/array of objects with specific keys/fields.

Like with the projects, I'll show you another example of the data in JSON format.

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "id": "github",
        "url": "https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/",
        "name": "GitHub"
    },
    {
        "id": "keybase",
        "url": "https://keybase.io/foo_dogsquared",
        "name": "Keybase"
    },
    {
        "id": "twitter",
        "url": "https://twitter.com/foo_dogsquared"
    }
]
----

Now, the list of keys. Thankfully, it's a lot shorter this time.

* `id` - The identifer of the contact. Similar to the `id` key from the `projects` data.
* `url` - The URL of the contact link.
* `name` - The name that'll appear in the output. Similar to the `name` key from the `projects` data, it'll use the `id` key if it's absent.
*This key is optional.*

The results from the previous example?
A list of contact links in the footer.

image:./docs/contact-links-sample.png[Contact links in the footer]


=== Filling the rest of the content

Something's missing in the portfolio.
Oh!
It's the description (and perhaps other stuff).
You can simply create a new content file named `_index.{md,adoc}` and write some stuff about it.

You can create another page at `content/$NAME.{md,adoc}` and write some more.
However, the theme will not list any top-level pages.
That's convenient.
Though, I do need a way to make it accessible for the visitor.

A simple problem requires simple answer.
We'll just add it into the main menu at the header.

Configuring menus is not different from any other themes (though, nested menus are not supported).

Let's say we have the following content directory structure:

[source,sh]
----
content
â”œâ”€â”€ about.adoc
â”œâ”€â”€ contact.adoc
â””â”€â”€ _index.adoc # This is your homepage content
----

To make them accessible through a menu, simply write similar configuration that follows:

[source,toml]
----
[menu]
    [[menu.main]]
        identifier = "about"
        name = "About"
        url = "about/"

    [[menu.main]]
        identifier = "contact"
        name = "Contact"
        url = "contact/"
----

Ta-da!
Now, you have a simple and complete portfolio page with the projects, contacts, stuff, and everything!


=== Other options

You can fiddle with other options.
Please see link:./MANUAL.adoc[the manual] for more information and options.

I'm pretty sure you want to see how to configure some theme and alternative themes, or how you could add a quick support section where you can e-beg for stuff.




== Making it as a blogging theme

Let's say you want to make it as a blogging theme as well.
This theme has you covered.

Take note that most of the stuff from making the portfolio site applies to this section.

Compared to configuring it as a portfolio site, this is where you'll seeing link:./MANUAL.adoc[the manual] multiple times.
Be sure to know it well so you'll have less problems settling with this theme.

Now, the theme aims to be minimal but customizable enough.
Unfortunately, the theme takes the meaning of minimal to its heart.
Therefore, some of the usual features you would normally see in most of the Hugo themes are disabled by default and you have to manually activate it.

* Hiding posts on the homepage? You have to set `params.hidePostsOnHome` to `true` for that.

* A theme toggle switch (dark mode toggle)?
Turn the `params.enableThemeToggle` on, please.

* How about some lazy syntax highlighting where you don't have to rely on the `highlight` shortcode?
Activate the `params.enableLazySyntaxHighlighting` switch!

* Can you please turn on the MathJax support on `params.enableMathjax`, honey?
I'm dying of the lack of MathJax support over here.

* Have you forget to check if the `params.enableContentPagination` is on again?
Now I don't have a "Read more" section on my post page.

* Thanks, sir!
Good thing you enabled `params.enableBreadcrumbs` or else I would've lost in that website for hours on end!

If those situations happened to you previously, link:./MANUAL.adoc[you should've read the manual more] and check the <<Making a blog site>> section to see the available options.


=== Content frontmatter

The theme doesn't have much options for the frontmatter since it goes out of its way as much as possible to future-proofing your content with less frontmatter.

But here's the list of the fields that the theme covers:

* `title`, `author`, and `date` which is the usual stuff.

* `tags` and `categories` which is also the usual stuff.
They are the https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/#default-taxonomies[default taxonomies].

* `cover` which is the featured cover image in the post.
I think this is the only custom field (aside from the `libs` which is discussed below).


=== Starter configuration

If you don't want to check the options for now, here's a starter config you can fiddle around with.
Simply uncomment/comment the options that you want to enable/disable.
It should be enough for starting a "minimal" blog site.

[source,toml]
----
baseURL = "https://example.com/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Arch Terminal"
description = "Generic description!"
summaryLength = 15
paginate = 5
copyright = "Unless explicitly stated, all content released here are licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0)."
canonifyURLs = true

[params]
    # The subtitle of the blog. Mostly appears in the <title> tag.
    subtitle = "Blogger"
    keywords = ["John Dodo", "ordinary-extinction", "blog"]

    # The tagline that'll appear in the homepage as the first header.
    tagline = "Making near destructive blogs all around the world."

    # Indicates if the site sections should be listed instead.
    # Requires `hidePostsOnHome` to be disabled.
    # listSiteSectionsOnHome = true

    # Puts a pagination section on the posts linking to the previous and next posts.
    # enableContentPagination = true

    # Indicates to show the icon whether the link leads to a page or a section.
    # The effect is visible if `hidePostsOnHome` is at least disabled.
    # showPageTypeIcon = true

    # 404
    notFoundHeader = "404 Not Found :("
    notFoundLinkMessage = "Now get back here."
    notFoundMessage = "I see you're an explorer. I like that."
----


=== Advanced configuration

Here's a sample of a more advanced configuration made for configuring this theme.
This includes RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds, SEO improvements, additional configurable views for your homepage and content, MathJax support, lazy syntax highlighting, and other tiny stuff.

Like the starter config, you can simply uncomment/comment certain things for the features that you want to enable/disable.

[source,toml]
----
baseURL = "https://example.com/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Arch Terminal"
description = "Generic description!"
summaryLength = 15
paginate = 5
copyright = "Unless explicitly stated, all content released here are licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0)."
canonifyURLs = true

# Defining the media type of the RSS and Atom feeds
# (you don't need to configure for JSON feeds since it's set at `index.json`)
[mediaTypes]
    [mediaTypes."application/atom+xml"]
        suffixes = ["atom", "atom.xml"] # You can remove the "atom.xml" if you want

    # Redefining RSS media type for the additional suffix
    [mediaTypes."application/rss+xml"]
        suffixes = ["rss", "rss.xml"] # You can remove the "rss.xml" if you want

    # You can set any media type you want but make sure it doesn't have any conflict with
    # other media types (that'll be used by your site, anyway).
    # Here's the list of registered media types for a reference.
    # https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
    [mediaTypes."x-application/search+json"]
        suffixes = ["search.json"]

# Including all of the feed output formats in the build
[outputFormats]
    [outputFormats.Rss]
        mediaType = "application/rss+xml"
        baseName = "index"

    [outputFormats.Atom]
        mediaType = "application/atom+xml"
        baseName = "index"

    [outputFormats.SearchIndex]
        mediaType = "x-application/search+json"
        baseName = "index"

# Indicating what output formats shall be included for the following kinds
[outputs]
    # .Site.BaseURL/index.* is available
    home = ["HTML", "JSON", "RSS", "ATOM", "SEARCHINDEX"]

    # .Site.BaseURL/$section/index.* is available
    section = ["HTML", "JSON", "RSS", "ATOM"]

# Your parameters for the theme
[params]
    # The subtitle of the blog. Mostly appears in the <title> tag.
    subtitle = "Blogger"
    keywords = ["John Dodo", "ordinary-extinction", "blog"]

    # The tagline that'll appear in the homepage as the first header.
    tagline = "Making near destructive blogs all around the world."

    # Hide posts on home. :)
    # hidePostsOnHome = true

    # SEO improvements
    # enableTwitterCard = true
    # enableOpenGraphSchema = true
    # enableJsonLdSchema = true

    # Indicates if the site sections should be listed instead.
    # Requires `hidePostsOnHome` to be disabled.
    # listSiteSectionsOnHome = true

    # Puts a pagination section on the posts linking to the previous and next posts.
    # enableContentPagination = true

    # Include image zoom feature similar to Medium articles
    # enableContentImageZoom = true

    # Enables syntax highlighting. ;p
    # enableLazySyntaxHighlighting = true

    # Indicates to show the icon whether the link leads to a page or a section.
    # The effect is visible if `hidePostsOnHome` is at least disabled.
    # showPageTypeIcon = true

    # Shows breadcrumbs in the post.
    # enableBreadcrumbs = true

    # Places a theme toggle button at the header logo
    # enableThemeToggle = true

    # Enable MathJax support
    # enableMathjax = true

    # 404
    # notFoundHeader = "404 Not Found :("
    # notFoundLinkMessage = "Now get back here."
    # notFoundMessage = "I see you're an explorer. I like that."

    # Enable content counters similar to LaTeX counters
    # useContentCounters = true
----


=== RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds support

For those who are looking to find more ways of distributing their content into the world of crap, an output feed might fill your needs.

This theme support three major output feed formats:

* https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html[RSS]
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287[Atom]
* https://jsonfeed.org/[JSON feeds]

The theme also support output feeds for site sections so that your visitors can subscribe to only a specific section of your site.

In order to enable it, utilize https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats[custom output formats] to your Hugo site config.

Here's a sample template of enabling support of all of them.

[source,toml]
----
[mediaTypes]
    [mediaTypes."application/atom+xml"]
        suffixes = ["atom"]

    [mediaTypes."application/rss+xml"]
        suffixes = ["rss"]

[outputFormats]
    [outputFormats.RSS]
        mediaType = "application/rss+xml"
        baseName = "index"
        isPlainText = false

    [outputFormats.Atom]
        mediaType = "application/atom+xml"
        baseName = "index"
        isPlainText = false

[outputs]
    home = ["HTML", "RSS", "ATOM", "JSON"]
    section = ["HTML", "RSS", "ATOM", "JSON"]
----

You can access them through `{{ $.Site.BaseURL }}/index.{rss,atom,json}`.

For specific site sections, you can visit them through the following template link:

....
{{ $.Site.BaseURL }}/{{ section }}/index.{rss,atom,json}
....




== Adding your own CSS and JS libraries

=== Adding it sitewide

This theme supports adding your own set of third-party (or your own) libraries to your site.
Thus, it can bring some features you want such as additional support for engineering-focused content with third-party libraries such as https://mermaidjs.github.io/[Mermaid] and https://www.chartjs.org/[Chart.js].
You can also replace MathJax with https://katex.org/[KaTeX] or replace the syntax highlighter libraries used here.

It can be done by utilizing a data file named `libraries` that holds a list of objects with the following keys:

* `type` (string) indicates the type whether it's a CSS or a JS library.
Can only accept possible values, `css` and `js`.

* `url` (string) which is the source of the script.
Also accepts relative links from your site which you can bring through the https://gohugo.io/content-management/static-files/[static folder].

* `weight` (number) dictates the importance of the script.
The less weight, the higher the precedence so make sure the important scripts have the least weight value.

* `sync` (boolean) indicates that the script shall be included with the page rendering.
All scripts will be asynchronously delivered (with `async` attribute).
Also, it'll bring down the perceived performance so make sure the script you'll be setting with this `key` is quite important to be loaded first.
*This key is optional.*

* `defer` (boolean) indicates that the script will be deferred.
Once the value is `true`, the script will be deferred no matter what.
*This key is optional.*

If you want finer control, I recommend to copy the script partial of this theme (at `themes/$THEME_NAME/layouts/partials/scripts.html`) and modify it.


=== Adding it for specific posts

TIP: If you plan on future-proofing your content, I recommend to embed them in the document instead.
This is a theme-specific feature and may pose some problems in the future when you're going to migrate it.

You can also add libraries for specific posts by providing the `libs` in the content frontmatter.
It is based on one of the content from the https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoBasicExample/blob/master/content/sketch/lines-from-center.html[basic
example].

It is more or less the same.
The `libs` key is an object/dictionary where it describes CSS and JS libraries.

Here's the frontmatter from the previously linked example.

[source,yaml]
----
---
title: "Lines from center"
date: 2019-03-04T22:15:42-03:00
description: "this is a p5js sketch"
libs:
  js:
    - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.7.3/p5.min.js
---
----

When the page is built, it'll have the p5.js library on the page specifically for that post.

Take note that all of the scripts included in this way are deferred.
If you want finer control (with the added benefit of future-proofing your content since this is theme-specific feature), you can embed them on the document itself, instead.

For Markdown files, you can simply write raw HTML.
For Asciidoctor documents, you can write the HTML inside of a https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#passthroughs[passthrough block].




== Lazy syntax highlighting

*This feature is only possible with Hugo extended verison.*
You can get around this with using the `libraries` data file.

The theme supports lazy syntax highlighting (that doesn't rely on the `highlight` shortcode) by setting `params.enableLazySyntaxHighlighting` to `true`.

This theme utilizes two syntax highlighting libraries for this which are https://prismjs.com/[PrismJS].

For PrismJS, it also has the "Keep Markup" plugin.
If you want to replace the files, the scripts are located at `assets/js/lib` of the theme folder.




== MathJax support

This theme supports mathematical typesetting with https://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax].
Like any of the features here, you have to manually activate it with `params.enableMathjax` with a `true` value.

By default, the theme use MathJax v3.0.0 (as of 2019-09-10).

If you want to configure MathJax, you can edit the script partial in `layouts/partials/scripts.html` in the root folder and write it there.




== How to contribute

If you spot some bugs or want to suggest a feature, feel free to file an issue in the issue tracker.

Any feature requests are heavily considered since starting at v2.0.0, a feature freeze is observed for the sake of improving user experience (including the documentations), bug fixes, and content readability for the theme as much as possible.
It also avoids the problem of over-engineering and gold plating since the theme already has a lot of options/parameters to offer.


=== Setting up for development

If you want to contribute through code, you can do the following to set up the repo into your computer:

* Fork this repository
* Clone the forked repository
* Checkout to the development branch (`develop`)
* Create another branch from the development branch which you can freely implement your own stuff

Make sure the new branch name is appropriately named.

If creating a pull request, you have to pass it through the development branch.


=== Project style guides

If you're going to update the codebase, make sure you mind the following guidelines:

* The documentations have to be written in https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].
If you're not familiar with it, here's the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[quick reference page] for a rundown and their https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[user manual] for deep details.

* The codebase follows the http://getbem.com/naming/[BEM naming convention] for the CSS naming.

* Using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines[semantic HTML] should be observed.

* Not really a requirement but use the https://editorconfig.org/[EditorConfig] plugin for your text editor.
If you don't have any, try to follow according to the `.editorconfig` rules.
