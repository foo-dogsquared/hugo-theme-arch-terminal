= Contributing
:toc:

Hello! 

If you're reading this, you might be interested in contributing to this project. 

Anyways, this is already mentioned in the README but for a quick recap:

== How to contribute

If you spot some bugs or want to suggest a feature, feel 
free to file an issue in the issue tracker. 



=== Setting up for development

If you want to contribute through code, you can do the following 
to set up the repo into your computer:

* Fork this repository 
* Clone the forked repository 
* Checkout to the development branch (`develop`) 
* Create another branch from the development branch which you can 
freely implement your own stuff 

Make sure the new branch name is appropriately named. 

If creating a pull request, you have to pass it through the 
development branch. 



=== Project style guides

If you're going to update the codebase, make sure you mind the 
following guidelines:

* The documentations have to be written in https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. 
If you're not familiar with it, here's the 
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[quick reference page] for 
a rundown and their https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[user manual] for 
deep details. 
* The codebase follows the http://getbem.com/naming/[BEM naming convention] 
for the CSS naming.
* Using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines[semantic HTML] 
should be observed.
* Not really a requirement but use the https://editorconfig.org/[EditorConfig] 
plugin for your text editor. 
If you don't have any, try to follow according to the `.editorconfig` rules. 




== Project scope

In order to prevent problems (for a theme), here are the the project 
self-imposed limitations and its scope: 

* This theme only serves to provide UI for the content. 
Meaning no custom shortcodes or archetypes shall be implemented. 
This also prevents the problem of migrating the content with some of it 
that relies on the theme. 
I encourage the users to make their own stuff instead. 

* Add only a minimal amount of custom parameters for the content frontmatter. 

* No more fonts shall be added for performance reasons. 
Instead, assume the most common installed system fonts and use those instead. 

* Content readability above content appearance. 
Typography practices should be strictly observed. 

* Using third-party libraries through a CDN is discouraged. 
Save it locally and use that instead. 
Be sure to document their versions for future references. 
(There are exceptions such as MathJax and KaTeX since it can also be used by other 
websites and could perform faster.) 

* As much as possible, keep and maintain the documentation 
inside of the project folder. 

* Starting from v2.0.0, there'll be a feature freeze to avoid 
maximum gold plating and over-engineering. 
If there's any small features to be requested and it is too small of a scope, it is 
encouraged to hack your own way out of this, instead. 
(Still, don't be afraid to request new features.)
